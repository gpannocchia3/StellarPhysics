\chapter*{Preface}

Not long ago, it occurred to me how cool it is when someone unexpectedly releases a very detailed and all-comprehensive version of their notes, especially when dealing with a course that has a handful of really different topics often interacting together in unpredictable, yet fascinating, ways----as it's the case for the Astrophysical Processes class.
\par These notes will be mainly based on \emph{my} own notes of the lectures by Professor Walter del Pozzo and Professor Marco Crisostomi during the academic year 2025-2026. However, since I take little to no pride in my messy notes, I'll be using more often than not some of the many references you can find on the course catalogue page or in the bibliography of this humble collection.
\par You can report errors (whatever their nature might be) and suggestions for additions at g.pannocchia3@studenti.unipi.it or through whatever convoluted way (conventional or not) you prefer\footnote{I'd like, however, not to see my house stormed by homing pidgeons.}.
\par Without further ado, we'd better not lose much more time on a preface and get started with it.

    \emph{There was Eru, the One, who in Arda is called Ilúvatar; and he made first the Ainur} [...] \emph{But for a long while they sang only each alone, or but few together, while the rest hearkened; for each comprehended only that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren they grew but slowly. \\ \vspace{3pt}
    Yet ever as they listened they came to deeper understanding, and increased in unison and harmony.}
