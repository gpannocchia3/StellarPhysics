\chapter*{About me}
\large
Hi there, I'm Giacomo, sometimes known as Cael by a very small niche of people, the author of the notes you just finished reading.
\par I'm a Batchelor-graduate student at the University of Pisa now in the process of undertaking a major (Master degree) in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the same university. In my (meager) free time I'm an avid reader, gamer, anime-enthusiast as well as an independent author in the very process of publishing his first novel.
\par For those of you that may be interested I'll leave both the link to the novel's page as well to my instagram profile in the QRcodes right below.

Come say hi if you fancy action-fantasy stories with magic, swords, some comedy to garnish and a lot of other stuff :)

\par At last but not the least, I want to thank all my collegues and fellow students that helped (and hopefully will help me again) during the drafting of this text, pointing out errors and occasions for further expansion.
\par If you'd like your names to be included and take your fair share of credits, feel free to contact me and I'll add your name right away in the few lines that are left of this page.

\par I hope my understading of the complex interplayings going on in our Universe has managed to facilitate your own understading. \par If not, well... oopsie.
